Fretboard improvements

- iterating on ideas

Feedback on generated directions here:
- let's stick to horizontal
- direction 1 is promising. Let's riff on that.
- make fret markers darker. Put double markers on fret 12 should be between the strings, not on top of them (between 2nd and 3rd, 3rd and 4th)
- font is illegible in heatmap view. Let's try solid dots as in direction 2, show note and more details about stats (future) in a card on hover/tap.
- let's add one more state to look at -- quiz where user is supposed to tap on the fretboard. Want targets for that I think -- let's try solid circles.
