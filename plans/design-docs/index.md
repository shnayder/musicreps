# Design Docs

Broad architectural explorations, design reviews, and layout studies.

These documents explore **how** the system should be structured — they inform
implementation plans but aren't necessarily tied to a single feature branch.

See [guides/feature-process.md](../../guides/feature-process.md) for the design
spec template.
