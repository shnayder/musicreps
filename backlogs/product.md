# Product Backlog

Owner: product workstream Branch: workstream/product

## Prioritization principles

1. Make it work for me: major usefulness or usability blockers first
2. Validate big risks or unknowns early (e.g. app store, overall approach)
3. Ongoing process and tech improvements — pull in small ones regularly

## Goals

1. Reach acceptable usability for fretboard mode — getting close
2. Reach acceptable layout, UI design — just starting
3. Derisk testflight iOS app
4. Make agents more autonomous in extending the app

## Active

- Product vision is thin — the [NEEDS INPUT] placeholder needs real content: who
  is this for, what does mastery look like, what's the end state
- No tone/personality guidance — covers UI language, imagery feel, etc.
- No UX glossary — mode, quiz, round, item, fluent vs mastered, recall vs speed
- Roadmap fragmentation — vision.md, ideas.md, backlog overlap. Consolidate.
- Landing screen — follow up from claude/redesign-navigation-menu-xpSD4

## Backlog

- Home screen: what skills exist, what's my status on each
- "What should I work on next" recommendation
- "Have I practiced long enough?" — question count, coverage, recall status
- Show effort: how much practiced today, across modes, over time
- Show progress: response time trends, modes started -> mastered
- Cold start for non-novice: mark areas as "I know this" or fast-test mode
- Sequencing/prioritization/recommendation: Duo-path style, cadence levels, etc.
- Brief descriptions of each mode in the menu
- Explanation that orange border means "recommended"

## Future / Public Release

- Better name (Reflex Music?)
- iOS/Android support
- Marketing materials, landing page
- LLC or personal business
- Intro/landing screen
- Feedback loops (email, bug reports)
- Monetization plan

## New Modes to Consider

- Relative major/minor
- Chord tones on fretboard
- Common chord relationships / transposition
- Musical modes (Dorian, Lydian, etc.)
- Pentatonic scale notes
- Circle of fifths navigation
