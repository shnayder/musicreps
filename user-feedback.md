9yr old. Ukulele and piano beginner.

- "What am I supposed to do?"
  - "I'm like wha wha wha?"
  - figured it out without help

- Other modes: "I don't even know what these things are". Need some intro
  material after all? Explanation if what it is and why it's useful. And
  pointers to where to learn more.

- double tap zooms. It shouldn't.

- what does "fluent" mean
  - consistent terminology already in the backlog.

- quiz
  - make mistake -- feel frustrated. Help set expectations/mental mode --
    mistakes are fine. We're drilling, not performing.

- would you use this?
  - right now I don't really care about learning the fretboard. But if I did,
    sure.

- "Why are the recommended strings E & A"? UI doesn't explain.
  - check the algorithm too. And make debugging/viz tools for it.
  - progress tab should show recommendations, so you cna see them in context
  - having clearer rec logic internally and perhaps user visible might make
    sense. e.g. for fretboard:
    - naturals first. In string order on guitar. On uke, perhaps low->high or
      high-low.
    - once all naturals are kind of solid, add accidentals.

- looking at fretboard forever app
  - fun to play the sounds too. Web view not responsive enough though. Not going
    there yet, though it would be a good idea
